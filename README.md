# Design-of-Digital-Circuits-and-Systems

develop sophisticated digital circuits using the Altera DE1-SOC development board that utilizes the Cyclone V FPGA combined with peripheral devices.

## Lab 1 - Parking Lot Occupancy Counter 
Designed finite state machine to counter number of cars in parking lot

## Lab 2 - Memory blocks 
Implemented different ram modules on FPGA.

## Lab 3 - Display Interface 
Implemented bresenhem's line drawing algorithm in hardware and used it to for simple animation.

## Lab 4 - Implementing Algorithms to Hardware
Implemented bit counter algorithm and binary search algorithm to hardware and mapped it to FPGA.
