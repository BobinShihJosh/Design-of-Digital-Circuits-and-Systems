# Memory Blocks

In computer systems it is necessary to provide a substantial amount of memory. If a system is
implemented using FPGA technology, it is possible to provide some amount of memory by using the
memory resources that exist in the FPGA device. In this lab we will examine the general issues involved
in implementing such memory
