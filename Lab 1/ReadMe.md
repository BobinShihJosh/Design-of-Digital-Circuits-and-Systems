# Parking Lot Occupancy Counter

Consider a parking lot with a single entry and exit gate. Two pairs of photo sensors are used to monitor
the activity of cars, as shown in Figure 1. When an object is between the photo transmitter and the photo
receiver, the light is blocked, and the corresponding output is asserted to 1. By monitoring the events of
two sensors, we can determine whether a car is entering or exiting, or a pedestrian is passing through.
